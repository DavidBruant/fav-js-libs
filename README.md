# List of JavaScript libraries i use and recommend

List curated by David Bruant

## Client-side applications

**[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**\
Svelte is a library that enables to create and compose UI components

I've had a lot of experience with React, a little with Vue and vanilla JS (JavaScript with no framework) and my favorite dev experience has ben with Svelte

**[baredux](https://github.com/DavidBruant/baredux)**\
It's a state-management library that i have authored.

It's inspired by redux, vuex and rematch and is simpler than all that. It's 1 file of ~70 lines of code and will probably never get bigger than 100 lines

**[page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js)**\
a client-side routing library

I'm more comfortable with a dedicated client-side library that takes care of routing than the approaches Ã  la react-router which makes routes as components


## Client-side tools

**[d3-fetch](https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch)**\
A little known fact about [d3](https://d3js.org/) is that its parts can be used as independent modules

i love d3-fetch, because it's the fetch that should have been the browser fetch.\
While the [browser `fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch) requires two `.then()` to get to your result, d3.fetch gets to the point directly:

```js
fetch(url)
.then(resp => resp.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))

// compared to
import {json} from 'd3-fetch'

json(url)
.then(data => console.log(data))
```

d3-fetch also has the good idea to consider HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses as errors caught via `.catch()` while browser `fetch` considers them "successes" to be handled manually after a first `.then()`

## Tests

**[ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)**\
I've had experience with mocha and jest and i prefer ava
